## What is Mineblocks
Mineblocks is a math game for kids in which the player is in a mine and must mine different ores to get points. However, to successfully mine the ore, the player must correctly answer a basic addition, subtraction, multiplication or division question (operation is determined by the colour of the ore that the player is attempting to mine). The player can then use their points to buy eggs from the shop, each of which contains a different pet. In mineblocks, collecting pets is the incentive for playing, and further becomes an incentive to learn mental math.
